This is an introduction to github basics

Version control is a system that records changes to files over time so you can recall specific versions later. Git, SVN(subversion) are examples of version control.

Git is a version control system which allows developers to track changes to their codes over time. Linus Torvalds created Git in 2005. It also allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase and merge their changes together.
